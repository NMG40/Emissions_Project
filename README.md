Given the current climate emergency that has been afflicting the planet there has been a growing interest in using data to identify the most effective solutions to mitigate the effects of the changing temperatures. This current paper will be a part of a series of papers exploring the issue, specifically in the realm of city planning and how good urbanization may lead to lower carbon emissions without necessarily requiring the degrowth policies many politicians fear espousing.

In this paper, I will analyze data recovered from the Global Carbon Project, to determine the general distribution of carbon emissions across countries, across time periods and the correlation each of them have with total emissions. Then in the second part of the project, I recovered data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs that recorded household size data for a number of different countries at different times.
